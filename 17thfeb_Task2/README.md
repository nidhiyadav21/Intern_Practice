**Personal Finance Tracker API**

 Project Overview

Personal Finance Tracker is a scalable and modular REST API built using FastAPI and MongoDB to efficiently manage income and expense transactions.
The system is designed with clean architecture principles, asynchronous database operations, structured validation, and real-world financial tracking features such as filtering, bulk operations, and monthly summaries.
This project demonstrates backend development best practices including validation, dependency injection, async programming, and aggregation handling.

**Architecture & Design Approach**

The application follows a layered modular architecture:

API Layer – Handles routing and HTTP request/response lifecycle

Schema Layer – Data validation using Pydantic models

Core Layer – Configuration and database connection management

Dependency Layer – Reusable dependencies like pagination

The design ensures:

Separation of concerns

Clean and maintainable code

Scalable structure for future enhancements

**Technical Highlights**

Asynchronous API implementation using FastAPI

Async MongoDB integration via Motor

Structured request validation using Pydantic

Dependency Injection for database handling

MongoDB aggregation for financial summary

Bulk delete operations with date filtering

Query-based filtering (category & date range)

Proper HTTP status codes & exception handling

Environment-based configuration management
